I see you in candlelight, touching memories  
Like bruises, soft pressure escalates  
To pain. My grandfather taught me to touch  
Fire in taps and brushes, butterfly kisses  
With flame. 

Monarch butterflies nurse in milkweed,  
Daughters on poisoned breasts  
Assimilating toxins. Birthright  
Is an alembic  
Leaded with longing.  

(From introduction to interdiction leaded gasoline  
Cost the average American 2.6 IQ points.)

There are days I spend bedridden  
Sweating through sheets wandering  
Distraction by distraction---
Now, now, don't be drastic.  
We live in the age of microplastic;  
Drunk on Spanish wines, Swiss chocolates,  
French kisses plastic wrapped  
And tidily packed in single-portion  
Sachets. And I am still not happy.  
Today I am ribbon wrapped lead  
To water unmoored, ungoaled,  
And wishing to become.  

I wonder if it hurts, to fly  
On wings annealed in poison.  
All I know is the butterfly  
     still floats  
   like  
     wildfire  
over dusty riverbeds.
