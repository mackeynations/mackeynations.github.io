In the third hour of delay  
(My fault, my fault, no more buses)  
And the gray station lights perfumed  
With aberrant pixels  
Of televisions and the everlit  
*Distributeurs automatique* barricading  
The southwest front have swollen  
The orange air; passing cars  
Perverse reflections  
Of unseeable stars.  
Love and joy for all mankind  
Rings from shoddy speakers  
Infused with sportscasts  
Babycries bagcrinkles disassembling  
Soundspace in impossible bases.  
My thoughts, my only  
Holy possessions, rattle  
Like typewriter keys in a storm.  

Ink has pooled across the sky.  
Lotus-locked in our  
Cacophany, we carry on,  
Like ants, swarming to inscrutable  
Signals entombed in our  
Great works: aluminum, glass,  
Concrete, wood, earth.  

To map the structure of ant hills  
We cast them in aluminum. Elaborated  
Hallways, chambers, networks  
Like birch trees dressed in silver:  
A home, perfectly preserved,  
Its occupants insensibly  
Incorporated into the casting.  
If I have a religion it is this:  
That large truths are obliterations  
Of small ones, that parousia will not be  
A person, but a flood.
