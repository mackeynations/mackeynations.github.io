They say it is the fourth age  
Of men--and last. We cast  
Ourselves corrosively,  
Dressed in silicon  
And shimmering sand.  
Smoke enfolds the city  
Exhausting our topography  
As cars sputter to inscrutable  
Designs. I dream of ants,  
Swarming,  
Entombed in soft earth.  
To map the structure of anthills  
We cast them in aluminum. Elaborated  
Hallways, chambers, networks  
Like birch trees dressed in silver  
The occupants insensible  
Within the casting.  
I cannot breathe while dreaming.  
If I have a religion it is this:  
That large truths are obliterations  
Of small ones, that parousia will not be  
A person, but a flood.
